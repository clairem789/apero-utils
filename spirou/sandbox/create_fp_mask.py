"""
Creation of a FP CCF mask from the cavity lenght properties
The are no arguments to pass, you need to edit the first few
lines in this code. Variables should be pretty self-explanatory.

Logic behind the code:
    We have a cavity length and we know that the FP peaks will
    range from ~10 000 to ~25 000. We take the cavity length and
    derive the corresponding wavelengths to be used as a CCF 
    mask. The process has to be done in an iterative way as 
    the exact wavelength of a line affects the cavity length. The
    computation coverges in a few steps. The CCF mask is saved 
    with a blue/red edge that are -0.5*dv and 0.5*dv from the central
    line position. Peak weights are all set to 1.0.
